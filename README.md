in the main componnent there is a localhost server just to test.
there is a scrapper components for tiktok influencers by category - their info stats and more and write the data to a googlesheet file(optional)
function main get the influencers info in an array 1 array for tiktok and one for youtube - for both you need googleconsole api and service acount json
you will also need apify api from their website need to apply the api where is needed in the code in every component you need to plant your relevant api
for google sheet you will neeed the sheet id also and to enable googlesheet, v4 search youtube data ando mor in you google console 
main return 2 arrays and works only once there is a get request from the frontend for influencers might take a minute untill main would finish
sends the 2 arrays back as res and you can map and disply them in the web and there is an open react project with brouser router so you can add simillar componenets easy and not work twice
